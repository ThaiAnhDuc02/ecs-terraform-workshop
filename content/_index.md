# Infrastructure Terraform Integrated with GitHub Actions

#### Architecture

![image](/images/architecture.png)

#### Workflow

To complete this Workshop, we will follow a simple process as outlined below:

- Write the Terraform infrastructure code for the pre-defined system.
- Use commands to deploy the infrastructure on the AWS console.
- Deploy ECS Service on the pre-created infrastructure.
- Set up CI/CD to automate the deployment process.
- Create Monitoring to observe and manage the system.

This process ensures that the deployment of infrastructure, services, and CI/CD is fully automated, providing high efficiency and comprehensive control over the AWS-based system.
