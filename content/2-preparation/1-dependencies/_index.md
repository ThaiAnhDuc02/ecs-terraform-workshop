#### Core Knowledge

To better prepare for this workshop, you should review three exercises from the **AWS Study Group**:

- [Deploy Application on Docker Container](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/).
- [Deploy applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://000016.awsstudygroup.com/).
- [Deploying CI/CD with ECS Container](https://000017.awsstudygroup.com/)

Completing these exercises will help you gain a strong understanding of:

- How to deploy infrastructure on AWS.
- Using RDS for database management.
- Creating ECS to run containers for applications.
- Using an Application Load Balancer to distribute load evenly.
- Setting up CI/CD to automate application updates and deployment.
- Monitoring and tracking process performance.

Once you’ve mastered these concepts, you’ll be ready to deploy infrastructure quickly with just a few lines of code using Terraform. Now, let’s dive into the workshop and explore each step together!

#### Installing Dependencies

To start running code in Terraform, you’ll need:

- **Terraform CLI**: This command-line tool helps you manage and deploy infrastructure as code.
- **AWS CLI**: This tool allows Terraform to interact directly with AWS services, making it easy to manage cloud resources.
